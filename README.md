Dear players of Heroes of Might and Magic 3, today we bring you a MOD that makes changes to the game difficulty, mechanics and game balance. Everyone is welcomed to come and experience it soon."
Hereby, we solemnly declare that during the development of this mod, we have drawn on many other mods. However, due to the difficulty in getting in touch with the original authors, we were unable to inform them in a timely manner. We sincerely hope for everyone’s understanding.
The following is the list of the referenced mods:
- h3-ai-bonus(by luk3Z);
- exp small features(by bakaczh);
- boost-ai(by Nordsoft,val-gaav);
- warzyw-templates (by Warzyw647).

As the integrator, we wholeheartedly thank all the original authors for their hard work. Meanwhile, we also want to thank Phoenix As a Dream & Master Lu (L) for their guidance, especially Zi Yue Yan Xiao (Henry.Tao) for his great help. Without you, this MOD could not have reached this stage today.
